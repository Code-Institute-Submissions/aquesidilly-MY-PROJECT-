### EMMAROSS INTERNATIONAL
## Milestone Project 1
 * The aim of this project is to create a static front end site of at least 3 pages or sections using the technologies I have learned so far such as, HTML, Css, and optional Bootstrap or other libraries. The aim of the site is to present useful information in an ordered way to a set of users.
 * I have decided to created a website for a marketing household equipments. I have utilised all the elements I have learned in the previous modules to create this page and used principals of good user experience to create a responsive, well designed functional website.
 * My site consists of a landing page to introduce the the marketing company and the gallery page. The site then has 2 pages, one for the homepage which shows the goods or items in stock and the gallery to showcase the items the marketing company sells.

 ## Design
 # Colour Scheme
  * I used two main colours throughout this site, a gray and black. I alternated the text and background colour between my two main colours to create defined sections when scrolling and to create a slight monochrome feel.
  * I also used a blue for my hover effect on the links to show the user that they element is a link.
 # Typography
  * I wanted to create a strong look with my typography so i used a very graphic font Arial in large size for my headings, and Helvetica for all other text.
  * Both fonts where imported to my css stylesheet from Google Fonts.
  * I used sans-serif as a fall-back font in case for any reason my fonts were not imported.
 # Imagery
  * Imagery was very important to me and I choose images that conveyed the feel of the marketing company I wanted to present and placed them throughout the site.
  * Each section consists of a main title image that conveys to the user what the section is about.
  * I used one source for my images.
    - Unsplash
    - Pexels
  * I also placed video in each of the section pages with controls so the user can take a room tour, see some food being prepared for the resturant and see a treatment in the spa.
  * All video was sourced from.
    - Pexels
 # Icons
  * I used directional arrow icons from Font Awesome to encourage users to scroll and to show links to a seperate section page.

 ## Code Testing
   * My code has been passed throught the W3C, Css and HTML validator.

    - Home page passed Results
    - Sleep page passed Results
    - Eat page passed Results
    - Relax page passed Results
    - Booking form had a warning that input type="date didn't work on all browsers. Results
    - CSS file passed Results
 # Know issues
   * When I passed my booking form HTML code through the validator It warned that the input type="date" didn't work on all browsers. When I researched the issue the solution seemed to be to add some javascript to place a pollyfill. As this is currently out of my scope of knowledge I instead placed the date format of dd/mm/yyyy in the label for the date input to show the user what is expected in this input section. As my knowledge of javascript improves I will revisit the issue to improve on the solution.
 # Further Testing
 Once finished I tested the site across different screen sizes and different browsers.

  * I noticed the heading text was very small and less noticeable on smaller screens so I enlarged its size and added an opaque background to make it stand out more.
  * I also noticed some minor spelling mistakes which I have fixed.
  * I've also checked all links numerous times to make sure they all work.
 # 404 error
  * I used github to add a custom 404 error page if the user enters a wrong url to the page. I created a 404.html page on my repository by clicking the add file button and then added my html and css to it. I've added my navbar and footer to this page as well as a link back to the index.html page.
 ## Deployment
 Github, Gitpod, Git and Gitub pages
 To start the project I used Github and Gitpod.

  1. I first created a repository cloning the Code Institutes template on my github page.
  2. Once created I opened the page in Gitpod.
  3. I then used the terminal to create my index.html file ie, touch index.html.
  4. I then created my assets folder ie, mkdir assets, to hold my images and my css folder.
  5. I then created the style.css file within the css folder.
  6. I then created the other pages sleep.html, eat.html, relax.html and booking-form.html.
 Git

  1. Once I created the main files and folders I then used the git add . command to add them to the staging area.
  2. Once they were staged I then used git commit -m "initial commit" to commit them to github.
  3. I then used git push to push the files onto my gihub page.
  4. I used these steps to commit the project regularly throughout the development to keep everything saved and up to date on my github.
 To make my project live I then used github pages.

  1. I First signed into github and located my repository
  2. At the top of the repository I selected the settings option.
  3. I then scrolled down the page until I reached the github pages section.
  4. Under sources I selected the Master Branch.
  5. The page then refreshed itself.
  6. I then scrolled back down and the link to my live page was then visible.
